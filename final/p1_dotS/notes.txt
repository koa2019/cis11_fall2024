To do:

* CHANGE numTrys TO 10 BEFORE SUBMITTING!

* Figure out how to make the getRand() to generate smaller numbers. 0-9, or 10-99, 0-99?

* Record video of the game running.

* Take screenshots of how to compile, run and play the game and then put them into a document.

DONE * Need to change how the game prints out wrong guesses. It should print all 4 digits and then show which ones are right and wrong. 
  As of now it will stop printing at the first occurence of a wrong digit guess.

DONE * final-7.s BUG after commenting setGuess() back in. numTrys=2 but after 2nd wrong guess it still 
  loops to "Attempt #3"
  --> Test inputs: 1234, 4567, 6618, 6615

DONE * checkPassword() is broken. 
    - returns r0=true no matter what
    USE test inputs:
        6612 returns correct
        6675 returns wrong and num attempts skips from 1 to 3
    - isRight and isWrong labels are breaking it when they print


DONE * final-1 printArr() is printing predefined numbers wrong
        --> based it off of Risher's array1.s outputArr: func 
        --> --> Why did he push/pop {r0-r3} ?
