* checkPassword() is broken. 
    - returns r0=true no matter what
    USE test inputs:
        6612 returns correct
        6675 returns wrong and num attempts skips from 1 to 3
    - isRight and isWrong labels are breaking it when they print


* final-1 printArr() is printing predefined numbers wrong
--> based it off of Risher's array1.s outputArr: func 
    Why did he push/pop {r0-r3} ?

* You can change setGuess() to have no paramters and access variables 
   size & guess[] directly inside of the function because it stores it.
--> See risher's wk12>sumUserDefined
