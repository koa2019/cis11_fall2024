* Ask risher about line 145

* final-7.s BUG after commenting setGuess() back in. numTrys=2 but after 2nd wrong guess it still 
  loops to "Attempt #3"
  --> Test inputs: 1234, 4567, 6618, 6615

DONE * checkPassword() is broken. 
    - returns r0=true no matter what
    USE test inputs:
        6612 returns correct
        6675 returns wrong and num attempts skips from 1 to 3
    - isRight and isWrong labels are breaking it when they print


DONE * final-1 printArr() is printing predefined numbers wrong
        --> based it off of Risher's array1.s outputArr: func 
        --> --> Why did he push/pop {r0-r3} ?

* You can change setGuess() to have no paramters and access variables 
   size & guess[] directly inside of the function because it stores it.
    --> See risher's wk12>sumUserDefined
