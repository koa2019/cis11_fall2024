# cis11_fall2024 final project 1: Master Mind
assembly, raspberry pi

All submissions must have a readme document that explains how to run, compile, build, and play your project. These instructions need to be written for someone that has no experience in computer science. I also want a video for all projects of you playing the game if you are building a GPIO project show me the board as well as any console content.

Project 1:
    Master Mind - In this project, you will write an ARM32 assembly program to implement a simplified Mastermind game. The program will use arrays to store a predefined 4-digit secret code and the userâ€™s guesses. You will need to implement functions such get input (to read user input using scanf), check guess (to compare the guess with the secret code), and print feedback (to display the number of exact and partial matches using printf). The game will loop up to 10 times, providing feedback after each guess and ending if the player guesses correctly or exhausts all attempts. mastermind game instructions.jpg
