How to compile & run in terminal: 

c/c++:
    File needs an excutable file to run. If it doesn't already exist, then you need to build/compile it.
    The excutable is named "fileName" FYI: It doesn't have a file extension. To build/compile:
	
	    * run button on top right corner to run c/c++

      * run tab > debug c/c++ file

c file:

      * g++ fileName.c
	      ./a.out

	    * g++ fileName.c && ./a.out

cpp file:

      * g++ fileName.cpp 
	      ./a.out
	
	    * g++ fileName.cpp && ./a.out


arm7 assembly .s:
    as -o fileName.o fileName.s 
    ld -o fileName fileName.o
    ./fileName
    

arm7 assembly with C language .s:

    * gcc fileName.s 
      ./a.out

    * gcc -o fileName fileName.s 
      ./fileName

    * gcc -o fileName fileName.s && ./a.out

    * gcc -o fileName fileName.s && ./fileName
