Lab 7 Array

I would advise writing this in c/c++ first as it will help you to debug any issues with logic there. 
Please submit the arm programs in separate files with the following schema lab7probX.s in one zip file. 
Remember late submissions are only worth 50% at best.

1. Largest/Smallest Array Values
	Write a program that lets the user enter ten values into an array. 
	The program should then display the largest and smallest values stored in the array.

2. Rainfall Statistics
	Write a program that lets the user enter the total rainfall for each of 12 months 
	into an array of 4-byte integers. 
	The program should calculate and display:
		1. the total rainfall for the year
		2. the average monthly rainfall, 
		3. the months with the highest and lowest amounts.
	Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers for monthly rainfall figures.
	Note: use the divMod function from the usefulFunctions on the github to perform division. 
	      When compiling this program be sure to include the divmod.s file. Ex. gcc yourfile.s divmod.s

3. Reverse An Array Inplace
	Develop a program that reverses an array of integers in-place. 
	This program should reserve a 6 element 4-byte array that the user can fill with their own numbers. 
	Output: 
		* the user inputed array 
		* then reverse it inplace and output the resulting reversed array.
	Note: At a minimum use functions for the inputting the array and the outputing the array.
